If the Express server has been ungracefully terminated the socket listening on port 24091 may still be open.
This stops you starting the server again on the port.
Use this command to force kill the socket so the server can be started again:

    kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:24091)

or if on Linux this command may prove more useful:
    fuser -k 24091/tcp
